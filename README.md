# gritty-fluff

## This is an early prototype of a game called Gritty Fluff that I would like to continue making! My eventual plan for this game is to make it a more full, polished social simulation game.

## I created the wolf model and animations and created the project in Unity3d!

Special Thanks to Abby Alperovich (abby.alps@gmail.com) for help with initial design-work and scoping! :)

# Keep checking back, as I'm continually working on this project!
